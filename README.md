# Machine Learning Model Collection

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Model Collection** repository! This repository contains a variety of AI models, most of them would be implemented in a Jupyter Notebook with Google Colab Link. The goal is to provide a comprehensive reference of models across different domains and use cases.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each containing,

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Each notebook demonstrates the model's working, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, along with visualizations for better understanding.
- **Folder-Level README**: Each folder has a README that gives a brief overview of the specific model, its purpose, and important theories.

## Models Included

This repository aims to include models covering a range of machine learning topics, such as:

- **Supervised Learning**: Classification, regression, etc.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, etc.
- **Basic Architectures of NLP**: Transformers, BERTs, GPTs, etc.

Each model is contained in its own folder for easy navigation and modular exploration.

## Dependencies

While each notebook lists its specific dependencies, here are some common libraries across models:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch`

If you run the notebook in Colab, there will be install code if it's necessary.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by adding new models, improving existing notebooks, or updating documentation.
